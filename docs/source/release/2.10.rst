Version 2.10
============

Breaking changes
----------------

* If you want to exclude a specific folder, you need to use a wildcard character at the end of the folder name.
  For example, to exclude the folder ``/tmp/foo``, you need to use ``/tmp/foo/*``. Thanks to dadoonet.
* The way we run docker images has changed. We don't need anymore to specify the fscrawler binary.
  So running ``docker run -it -v ~/.fscrawler:/root/.fscrawler -v /documents:/tmp/es:ro dadoonet/fscrawler job_name`` is
enough. Thanks to dadoonet.
* FSCrawler does not display anymore the list of existing jobs when no job name is provided.
  You need to use the ``--list`` option to list the jobs. Thanks to dadoonet.
* When launching for the first time FSCrawler with a job name, FSCrawler does not create anymore the job
  configuration folder with default settings. You need to use the ``--setup`` option to create the job settings.
  Thanks to dadoonet.

New
---

* FSCrawler does not need to wait until the next planned scan to scan again the filesystem. You can just remove the
  line ``next_check`` in the ``~/.fscrawler/{job_name}/_status.json`` file and FSCrawler will start a new scan
  immediately.
* Job settings can be defined by env variables and system properties and you can also split the configuration of
  jobs using multiple files in the ``~/.fscrawler/job/_settings`` directory. Also note that the system properties
  need to be set in the ``FS_JAVA_OPTS`` environment variable.
* Add support for automatic semantic search when using a 8.17+ version with a trial or enterprise
  license. See :ref:`semantic_search`. **Warning**: this might slow down the ingestion process. Thanks to dadoonet.
* Add support for Elastic cloud serverless. Thanks to dadoonet.
* Using the REST API ``_document``, you can now fetch a document from the local dir, from an http website
  or from an S3 bucket. See :ref:`rest-service`. Thanks to dadoonet.
* You can now remove a document in Elasticsearch using FSCrawler ``_document`` endpoint. See :ref:`rest-service`. Thanks to dadoonet.
* Implement our own HTTP Client for Elasticsearch. Thanks to dadoonet.
* Add option to set path to custom tika config file. See :ref:`local-fs-settings`. Thanks to iadcode.
* Support for Index Templates. See :ref:`mappings`. Thanks to dadoonet.
* Support for Aliases. You can now index to an alias. Thanks to dadoonet.
* Support for Access Token and Api Keys instead of Basic Authentication. See :ref:`credentials`. Thanks to dadoonet.
* Allow loading external jars. This adds a new ``external`` directory from where jars can be loaded
  to the FSCrawler JVM. For example, you could provide your own Custom Tika Parser code. See :ref:`layout`. Thanks to dadoonet.
* Add temporal information in folder index. Thanks to bdauvissat
* Add support for external metadata files while crawling, defaults to ``.meta.yml``. See :ref:`tags` Thanks to dadoonet.
* The job name is not mandatory anymore and it will be ``fscrawler`` by default. Thanks to dadoonet.
* FSCrawler also supports Elasticsearch 9. Thanks to dadoonet.

Fix
---

* Closed open file streams after use. Thanks to alexbluesteele.
* ``fs.ocr.enabled`` was always false. Thanks to ywjung.
* Do not hide YAML parsing errors. Thanks to dadoonet.
* Fix duration parsing for the day unit ``d``. Thanks to dadoonet.

Deprecated
----------

* The ``_upload`` REST endpoint has been deprecated. Please now use the ``_document`` endpoint. Thanks to dadoonet.
* Support for Elasticsearch 6.x is deprecated. Thanks to dadoonet.
* Support for Basic Authentication is deprecated. You should use API keys instead. Thanks to dadoonet.

Updated
-------

* Files are now sorted by date with a reverse order. So the most recent files should be indexed first. Thanks to dadoonet.
* Add full support for Elasticsearch |ES_version8|_, |ES_version7|_, |ES_version6|_. Thanks to dadoonet.
* Update to Tika |Tika_version|_. Thanks to dadoonet.

Removed

Thanks to ``@dadoonet``, ``@ywjung``, ``@iadcode``, ``@bdauvissat``, ``@alexbluesteele``
