Clone the project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use git to clone the project locally::

    git clone git@github.com:dadoonet/fscrawler.git
    cd fscrawler

Build the artifact
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build the project, run::

    mvn clean package

The final artifacts are available in ``distribution/target``.

.. tip::

    To build it faster (without tests), run::

        mvn clean package -DskipTests

Integration tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When running from the command line with ``mvn`` integration tests are ran against a real
Elasticsearch instance launched using Docker (via `Testcontainers <https://java.testcontainers.org/modules/elasticsearch/>`_).

Run tests from your IDE
"""""""""""""""""""""""

To run integration tests from your IDE, you need to start tests in ``fscrawler-it`` module.
But you can specify the Maven profile to use and rebuild the project.

* ``es-8x`` for Elasticsearch 8.x
* ``es-7x`` for Elasticsearch 7.x

Faster integration tests
""""""""""""""""""""""""

As we are using `Testcontainers <https://java.testcontainers.org/modules/elasticsearch/>`_,
we can `reuse <https://java.testcontainers.org/features/reuse/>`_ the Elasticsearch container instead of having to restart
one everytime.

.. note:: You need to explicitly `enable this feature <https://java.testcontainers.org/features/reuse/>`_.

If you run from the IDE, reusing containers is the default behavior. But if you run the CLI, you need
to set ``tests.leaveTemporary`` to ``true``::

    mvn verify -Dtests.leaveTemporary=true

Run a specific test from your Terminal
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To run a specific integration test, just run::

    mvn verify -am -Dtests.class=fr.pilato.elasticsearch.crawler.fs.test.integration.CLASS_NAME -Dtests.method="METHOD_NAME"

Run tests with an external cluster
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Launching the docker containers might take some time so if to want to run the test suite against an already running
cluster, you need to provide a ``tests.cluster.url`` value. This will skip launching the docker instances.

To run the test suite against an elasticsearch instance running locally, just run::

    mvn verify -pl fr.pilato.elasticsearch.crawler:fscrawler-it -Dtests.cluster.url=https://localhost:9200

.. hint::

    If you are using an external cluster, you must set the ``tests.cluster.apiKey`` if your cluster does not use
    ``elastic`` and ``changeme`` as their credentials, and it's anyway the recommended approach::

        mvn verify -pl fr.pilato.elasticsearch.crawler:fscrawler-it \
            -Dtests.cluster.apiKey=APIKEYHERE \
            -Dtests.cluster.url=https://localhost:9200 \

    If the cluster is using a self generated SSL certificate, you can bypass checking the certificate by using
    ``tests.cluster.check_ssl``::

        mvn verify -pl fr.pilato.elasticsearch.crawler:fscrawler-it \
            -Dtests.cluster.apiKey=APIKEYHERE \
            -Dtests.cluster.url=https://localhost:9200 \
            -Dtests.cluster.check_ssl=false

.. hint::

    To run tests against another instance (ie. running on
    `Elasticsearch service by Elastic <https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service>`_,
    you can also use ``tests.cluster.url`` to set where elasticsearch is running::

        mvn verify -pl fr.pilato.elasticsearch.crawler:fscrawler-it \
            -Dtests.cluster.apiKey=APIKEYHERE \
            -Dtests.cluster.url=https://ALIAS.es.REGION.CLOUD_PROVIDER.elastic.cloud

    You can use both Elasticsearch service and Serverless projects.

Changing the REST port
""""""""""""""""""""""

By default, FS crawler will run the integration tests using a randomly chosen port for the REST service.
You can change this by using ``tests.rest.port`` option::

    mvn verify -Dtests.rest.port=8280

When set to ``0`` (default value), the port is assigned randomly.

Randomized testing
""""""""""""""""""

FS Crawler uses the `randomized testing framework <https://github.com/randomizedtesting/randomizedtesting>`_.
In case of failure, it will print a line like::

    REPRODUCE WITH:
    mvn test -Dtests.seed=AC6992149EB4B547 -Dtests.class=fr.pilato.elasticsearch.crawler.fs.test.unit.tika.TikaDocParserTest -Dtests.method="testExtractFromRtf" -Dtests.locale=ga-IE -Dtests.timezone=Canada/Saskatchewan

You can just run the test again using the same seed to make sure you always run the test in the same context as before.

Tests options
"""""""""""""

Some options are available from the command line when running the tests:

* ``tests.leaveTemporary`` leaves temporary files after tests (and also the TestContainers instance). ``false`` by default.
* ``tests.parallelism`` how many JVM to launch in parallel for tests. ``auto`` by default which means that it depends on
  the number of processors you have. It can be set to ``max`` if you want to use all the available processors, or a
  given value like ``1`` to use that exact number of JVMs.
* ``tests.output`` what should be displayed to the console while running tests. By default it is set to ``onError`` but
  can be set to ``always``.
* ``tests.verbose`` ``false`` by default.
* ``tests.seed`` if you need to reproduce a specific failure using the exact same random seed.
* ``tests.timeoutSuite`` how long a full suite of tests can run. It's set by default to ``60000`` which means 1 minute.
* ``tests.timeout`` how long a single test can run. It's set by default to ``120000`` which means 2 minutes.
* ``tests.locale`` by default it's set to ``random`` but you can force the locale to use.
* ``tests.timezone`` by default it's set to ``random`` but you can force the timezone to use, like ``CEST`` or ``-0200``.
* ``tests.nightly`` if you want to run the tests which are taking a significant time to run, set it to ``true``.
  ``false`` by default.

For example::

  mvn install -rf :fscrawler-it \
    -Dtests.output=always \
    -Dtests.locale=fr-FR \
    -Dtests.timezone=CEST \
    -Dtests.verbose \
    -Dtests.leaveTemporary \
    -Dtests.seed=E776CE45185A6E7A

Check for vulnerabilities (CVE)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The project is using `OSS Sonatype service <https://ossindex.sonatype.org/>`_ to check for known
vulnerabilities. This is ran during the ``verify`` phase.

Sonatype provides this service but with a anonymous account, you might be limited
by the number of tests you can run during a given period.

If you have an existing account, you can use it to bypass this limit for anonymous users by
setting ``sonatype.username`` and ``sonatype.password``::

        mvn verify -DskipTests \
            -Dsonatype.username=youremail@domain.com \
            -Dsonatype.password=yourverysecuredpassword

If you want to skip the check, you can run with ``-Dossindex.fail=false``::

        mvn clean install -Dossindex.fail=false

If a CVE needs a temporary exclusion, you can add it to the ``excludeVulnerabilityIds`` list
of the ``ossindex`` maven plugin in the ``pom.xml`` file::

    <configuration>
        <excludeVulnerabilityIds>
            <!-- LINK TO CVE and COMMENT -->
            <excludeVulnerabilityId>CVE-2022-1471</excludeVulnerabilityId>
        </excludeVulnerabilityIds>
    </configuration>

Docker build
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The docker images build is ran when calling the maven ``package`` phase. If you want to skip the build of the images,
you can manually use the ``docker.skip`` option::

        mvn package -Ddocker.skip

DockerHub publication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To publish the latest build to `DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/r/dadoonet/fscrawler/>`_ you can manually
call ``docker:push`` maven task and provide credentials ``docker.push.username`` and ``docker.push.password``::

        mvn -f distribution/pom.xml docker:push \
            -Ddocker.push.username=yourdockerhubaccount \
            -Ddocker.push.password=yourverysecuredpassword

Otherwise, if you call the maven ``deploy`` phase, it will be done automatically.
Note that it will still require that you provide the credentials ``docker.push.username`` and ``docker.push.password``::

        mvn deploy \
            -Ddocker.push.username=yourdockerhubaccount \
            -Ddocker.push.password=yourverysecuredpassword

You can also provide the settings as environment variables:

*  ``env.DOCKER_USERNAME`` or ``DOCKER_USERNAME``
*  ``env.DOCKER_PASSWORD`` or ``DOCKER_PASSWORD``
