Incompatible 3rd party library licenses
=======================================

Some libraries are not Apache2 compatible. Therefore they are not
packaged with FSCrawler so you need to download and add manually them to
the ``lib`` directory:

-  for JBIG2 images, you need to add |Levigo_version|_ library
-  for TIFF images, you need to add |Tiff_version|_ library
-  for JPEG 2000 (JPX) images, you need to add |JPEG2000_version|_ library

See
`pdfbox documentation <https://pdfbox.apache.org/2.0/dependencies.html#jai-image-io>`__
for more details.
