Tips and tricks
===============

Moving files to a “watched” directory
-------------------------------------

When moving an existing file to the directory FSCrawler is watching, you
need to explicitly ``touch`` all the files as when moved, the files are
keeping their original date intact:

.. code:: sh

   # single file
   touch file_you_moved

   # all files
   find  -type f  -exec touch {} +

   # all .txt files
   find  -type f  -name "*.txt" -exec touch {} +

Or you need to :ref:`restart <cli-options>` from the
beginning with the ``--restart`` option which will reindex everything.

Indexing from HDFS drive
------------------------

There is no specific support for HDFS in FSCrawler. But you can `mount
your HDFS on your
machine <https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/MountableHDFS>`__ and run FS
crawler on this mount point. You can also read details about `HDFS NFS
Gateway <http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsNfsGateway.html>`__.
